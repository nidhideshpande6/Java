# Lambda Expression, Consumer Interface, and forEach

## 1. Lambda Expression

A **lambda expression** is a concise way to represent an instance of a functional interface (an interface with only one abstract method). It allows you to write a function in a more compact and readable manner.

### Syntax:
```java
(parameter1, parameter2, ...) -> expression
```

### Example:
```java
// Lambda expression to print a message
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello, World!");
r.run();
```

In the example above, we have a lambda expression that implements the `Runnable` interface. The expression `() -> System.out.println("Hello, World!")` represents the implementation of the `run()` method.

## 2. Consumer Interface

The `Consumer` interface in Java is part of the `java.util.function` package. It represents an operation that takes a single input argument and returns no result. It is often used to perform operations on objects, such as printing or modifying them.

### Syntax:
```java
Consumer<T> consumer = (T t) -> { /* operation on t */ };
```

### Example:
```java
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public class ConsumerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Consumer that prints the value
        Consumer<String> print = (String str) -> System.out.println(str);

        // Apply the Consumer to a string
        print.accept("Hello, Consumer!");
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Consumer` takes a `String` as an argument and prints it. The `accept()` method is used to invoke the lambda.

## 3. forEach Method

The `forEach` method is part of the `Iterable` interface, which is implemented by collections like `List`, `Set`, etc. It allows you to iterate over elements in a collection and apply an operation to each element. You can pass a lambda expression as the action to be performed on each element.

### Syntax:
```java
collection.forEach(element -> { /* operation on element */ });
```

### Example:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ForEachExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // List of integers
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        // Using forEach to print each number
        numbers.forEach(number -> System.out.println("Number: " + number));
    }
}
```

In this example, `forEach` is used to print each element in the `List` of integers. The lambda expression `number -> System.out.println("Number: " + number)` is applied to each element of the list.

## Summary

- **Lambda expressions** provide a shorthand for writing instances of functional interfaces.
- The **Consumer interface** represents an operation that takes a single input and returns no result.
- The **forEach** method is used to iterate over elements in a collection and apply a given operation to each element.

These features together make it easier and more readable to perform operations on collections and other functional interfaces.

# Java 8 Interface Methods

## 1. Default Methods in Java 8

### Definition:
A **default method** is a method in an interface that has a body (implementation). Prior to Java 8, all methods in interfaces were abstract, meaning they did not have a body and had to be implemented by the classes that implemented the interface. With Java 8, you can now provide a **default implementation** for methods in an interface, which can be overridden or used by the implementing class.

### Syntax:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    // Default method
    default void myDefaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method in the interface.");
    }
}
```

### Key Points About Default Methods:
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default methods allow you to add new methods to an interface without breaking existing implementations. If a class implements an interface, and the interface adds a new default method, the class doesn't need to change unless it wants to override the default implementation.
- **Can Be Overridden**: A class implementing the interface can override a default method if it needs custom behavior.
- **Cannot Be Abstract**: Default methods must provide a body; they cannot be abstract.
- **Can Coexist with Abstract Methods**: An interface can have both abstract and default methods.

### Example:
```java
interface MyInterface {
    // Abstract method
    void abstractMethod();

    // Default method
    default void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is the default method implementation.");
    }
}

class MyClass implements MyInterface {
    // Implementing the abstract method
    @Override
    public void abstractMethod() {
        System.out.println("Implemented abstract method.");
    }

    // Optional: Overriding the default method
    @Override
    public void defaultMethod() {
        System.out.println("Overridden default method.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.abstractMethod();  // Output: Implemented abstract method.
        obj.defaultMethod();   // Output: Overridden default method.
    }
}
```

## 2. Why Default Methods?

Before Java 8, adding new methods to an interface would break existing implementations. For example:
- If you added a method to an interface, all classes that implemented the interface would need to provide an implementation for the new method.
- Java 8's introduction of default methods allows you to add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing code.

## 3. Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between an abstract method and a default method in an interface?
**Answer:**
- An **abstract method** is a method without a body. It must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
- A **default method** has a body (implementation) in the interface itself. Classes implementing the interface can either use the default implementation or override it.

### Q2: Can we have a constructor in an interface?
**Answer:**
No, interfaces cannot have constructors. Interfaces are not meant to be instantiated directly; they define abstract behavior that implementing classes should fulfill.

### Q3: Can default methods be overridden in a class implementing the interface?
**Answer:**
Yes, a class can override the default method provided by the interface. If the class doesn't override it, the default implementation from the interface is used.

### Q4: Can we have a default method and an abstract method with the same name in an interface?
**Answer:**
No, if an interface provides both an abstract method and a default method with the same signature, it will result in a compile-time error because the compiler won't know which method to call.

### Q5: What happens if a class implements two interfaces with default methods that have the same signature?
**Answer:**
If two interfaces have conflicting default methods (same method signature), the implementing class will get a **compile-time error**. The class must provide its own implementation to resolve the conflict.

```java
interface Interface1 {
    default void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Interface1 method");
    }
}

interface Interface2 {
    default void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Interface2 method");
    }
}

class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    @Override
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Overridden method in MyClass");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.myMethod();  // Output: Overridden method in MyClass
    }
}
```

### Q6: What is the role of `static` methods in interfaces in Java 8?
**Answer:**
Java 8 introduced **static methods** in interfaces, allowing you to define methods that are called on the interface itself, not on instances of the interface. They can have implementations but cannot be overridden by implementing classes.

```java
interface MyInterface {
    static void myStaticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface.myStaticMethod();  // Output: This is a static method.
    }
}
```

### Q7: How do private methods in interfaces work (introduced in Java 9)?
**Answer:**
Private methods in interfaces can be used for internal code sharing and cannot be accessed from outside the interface. They can be used by default or static methods within the same interface.

```java
interface MyInterface {
    private void myPrivateMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a private method.");
    }

    default void defaultMethod() {
        myPrivateMethod();  // Using private method internally
        System.out.println("Default method.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface obj = new MyInterface() {};  // Anonymous class to use interface
        obj.defaultMethod();  // Output: This is a private method. Default method.
    }
}
```

## Summary:
- **Default methods** allow interfaces to have methods with a body, which can either be used as is or overridden by implementing classes.
- Java 8 interfaces can also have **static methods** and **private methods** (Java 9+), providing more flexibility.
- Interviewers often focus on how default methods are used to maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking changes.

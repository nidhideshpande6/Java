### In the declaration List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<>();:

# 1. <> (Diamond Operator)
**Purpose:** The <> is called the diamond operator, introduced in Java 7. It is used for type inference when creating a new instance of a class.

**Explanation:** In this case, <> allows the Java compiler to automatically infer the type (Integer in this case) on the right side of the assignment. You don't need to repeat the type (Integer) after new ArrayList<>();, as it can be inferred from the declaration of List<Integer> l.

Example:
```java
Copy code
List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<>(); // Integer is inferred by the compiler
```

# 2. () (Constructor Invocation)
**Purpose:** The () represents the constructor call to create a new instance of ArrayList.

**Explanation:** new ArrayList<>() is creating an object of type ArrayList, which is a class that implements the List interface. The constructor ArrayList<>() initializes an empty list. The () means you are using the default no-argument constructor of the ArrayList class.

```Example:
java
Copy code
List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<>(); // This calls the constructor of ArrayList
```
In summary:

<> (Diamond operator) is used for type inference.

() is used to invoke the constructor of the ArrayList class, creating a new instance.

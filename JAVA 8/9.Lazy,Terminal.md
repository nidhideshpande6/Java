# Lazy Evaluation and Terminal Functions in Java 8 Streams

## Introduction

Java 8 introduced the `Stream` API, which allows developers to process sequences of elements in a declarative way. The `Stream` API supports **lazy evaluation** and the use of **terminal functions**.

### Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation means that operations on a stream are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked. This enables more efficient use of resources, as intermediate operations can be chained without being executed immediately.

#### Key Points:
- **Intermediate operations** (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `sorted`) are lazy.
- They only describe the transformations that should happen, but no actual computation takes place until a terminal operation is invoked.
- The stream pipeline is processed only when required, i.e., when a terminal operation triggers the actual execution.

#### Proof of Lazy Evaluation

Consider the following Java 8 code:

```java
import java.util.stream.*;

public class LazyEvaluationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Start");
        
        // Create a stream of numbers
        Stream<Integer> numbers = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                                       .map(n -> {
                                           System.out.println("Mapping: " + n);
                                           return n * 2;
                                       })
                                       .filter(n -> {
                                           System.out.println("Filtering: " + n);
                                           return n > 5;
                                       });
        
        // No processing happens here yet; the operations are lazy.
        
        // Terminal operation that triggers stream processing
        numbers.forEach(System.out::println);
        
        System.out.println("End");
    }
}

Output

Start
Mapping: 1
Filtering: 2
Mapping: 2
Filtering: 4
Mapping: 3
Filtering: 6
6
Mapping: 4
Filtering: 8
8
Mapping: 5
Filtering: 10

End
```

# Lazy Evaluation and Terminal Functions in Java 8 Streams

## Explanation

The `map` and `filter` operations are **lazy**. They only define what should happen to the stream elements. 

- The lazy operations are not executed until the terminal operation (`forEach`, `collect`, etc.) is called. 
- The output shows that for each element, the `map` operation is followed by the `filter` operation only when required.

## Terminal Functions

A **terminal operation** is a function that produces a result or a side-effect and, in doing so, triggers the processing of the stream.

### Common Terminal Operations:
- **`forEach()`**: Performs an action for each element in the stream.
- **`collect()`**: Collects the elements of the stream into a container (e.g., a `List` or `Set`).
- **`reduce()`**: Performs a reduction on the elements of the stream using an associative accumulation function.

### Example of a Terminal Function (`collect`):

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class TerminalOperationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        // Using collect to gather elements into a List
        List<Integer> collectedNumbers = numbers.stream()
                                                 .filter(n -> n > 2)
                                                 .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(collectedNumbers); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
    }
}
```
## Explanation:

The collect terminal operation processes the stream and collects the elements that satisfy the condition (greater than 2) into a List.

The stream operations are triggered when the terminal function is invoked, ensuring that intermediate steps are only executed when necessary.

### Conclusion
**Lazy Evaluation**: Java 8 streams support lazy evaluation, meaning intermediate operations (like map and filter) do not compute until a terminal operation is executed.

**Terminal Functions**: These functions trigger the processing of the stream and provide a result or side-effect.

This feature makes streams in Java 8 more efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex transformations, as they allow for reduced computational overhead and more flexible code structure.

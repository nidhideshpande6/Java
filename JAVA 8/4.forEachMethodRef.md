# Java 8 Stream API Features: `forEach()` Method Reference (Part 9)

In Java 8, the `forEach()` method is a terminal operation of the Stream API that allows you to iterate over each element of the stream and perform a specified action. The `forEach()` method can accept a **lambda expression** or a **method reference** to define the action to be performed on each element.

---

## Using `forEach()` with Method Reference

A **method reference** is a shorthand notation for a lambda expression that calls a method. It refers to a method by its name, and the syntax looks like this:

```java
ClassName::methodName
Example

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceForEachExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave");

        // Using method reference to print each name
        names.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
## Breakdown of the Example:
**Stream Creation**: A List<String> is converted to a stream using .stream().

**forEach**: The forEach() method is called on the stream.

**Method Reference**: System.out::println is a method reference that points to the println method of the System.out object. It acts as a shorthand for the lambda expression name -> System.out.println(name).
## Key Points:
Lambda expression vs Method Reference:

Lambda: name -> System.out.println(name)

Method Reference: System.out::println

**Simplification:** Method references make the code more readable and concise, especially when the action is already defined as a method.

Example with a Custom Method Reference

If you have a custom method and want to use it with forEach(), you can define the method and refer to it using a method reference.

```java

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceForEachExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave");

        // Using custom method reference to print each name
        names.stream().forEach(MethodReferenceForEachExample::printName);
    }

    // Custom method to print the name
    public static void printName(String name) {
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
```
### Explanation:
**MethodReferenceForEachExample**::printName is a method reference pointing to the printName method in the same class.

This method is invoked for each element in the stream.

### Summary:
The forEach() method in the Java 8 Stream API can use method references for cleaner and more readable code.

You can use method references to refer to existing methods (like System.out::println) or to your own custom methods.
